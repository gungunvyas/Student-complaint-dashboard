# Student Complaint Power BI Dashboard

## About the Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard is designed to provide a clear overview of the top categories of student complaints within our college. By analyzing data collected from a Google Form, I have created a dataset that forms the backbone of this dashboard. The dashboard presents information in a compact and easily digestible format, making it convenient for faculty members and administrators to identify prevalent issues and take appropriate action.

## Dataset Creation

To gather data for this project, I initiated a survey among our fellow students using a Google Form. This form allowed students to submit their complaints freely, ensuring honest feedback. The responses were then collected and compiled into a dataset tailored for analysis in Power BI.

The exact datset is not provided dur to security reasons of the student info.

## Steps Taken to Create the Dashboard

### 1. Loading Data into Power BI

- We started by opening Power BI Desktop and importing the Excel file containing the student complaints data.
- In Power BI Desktop, we navigated to the "Home" tab and clicked on "Get Data." From there, we selected "Excel" and located our file.
- After selecting the file, we chose the specific sheet containing our dataset and loaded the data into Power BI.

### 2. Transforming Data in Power Query

- With the data loaded into Power BI, we entered the "Query Editor" by clicking on "Transform Data."
- In Power Query Editor, we performed various data transformations to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis. This included removing duplicates, renaming columns, and formatting data types.

- We also created calculated columns and measures to enhance the analysis capabilities of the dataset.

### 3. Creating Visualizations

- After transforming the data, we returned to the main Power BI Desktop interface to create visualizations.
- Using the "Visualization" pane, we selected different chart types such as bar charts, pie charts, and tables to represent the student complaints data.

- We customized each visualization to display relevant information, such as the count of complaints by category or the distribution of complaints over time.
- Interactive features such as slicers and filters were added to enable users to explore the data dynamically.
